"""drop_block_probe.py -- replay a captured conversation against the Messages API with the
preserved thinking controls turned on, and report what the API drops and why.

Dependency-free (Python 3.8+, urllib only). Credentials come from the environment and are never
printed: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (sent as x-api-key) or ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN (sent as
"Authorization: Bearer ..."; for example the short-lived token an OAuth login provides). When both
are set only the token is sent -- the API rejects a request carrying both headers. A bearer token
also gets the oauth-2025-04-20 beta value, which the API requires for OAuth and workload-identity
tokens.

    python3 drop_block_probe.py capture.jsonl --yes            # replay, mode drop_block (without --yes: plan only)
    python3 drop_block_probe.py capture.jsonl --yes --mode error   # the loud arm (expect 400s)
    python3 drop_block_probe.py captures/ --yes                # one conversation per *.jsonl file
    python3 drop_block_probe.py captures/ --yes --count-tokens # free first pass on the token-counting endpoint
    python3 drop_block_probe.py capture.jsonl --dry-run        # validate the capture, send nothing
    python3 drop_block_probe.py capture.jsonl --json out.json  # machine-readable results too
    python3 drop_block_probe.py --self-test --model <model-id> --yes # three tiny live requests (cents); exits 1 if the check is not running

First-party only: the probe speaks to the Claude API (POST /v1/messages). Captures
taken on Amazon Bedrock or Google Cloud Vertex AI cannot be replayed here -- their request shape,
authentication and per-model availability of the controls differ; run the account's own client
there and read input_transformations from its responses.

Use a key from the SAME organization as the capture (a dedicated key or workspace is fine; a
capture replayed with a different organization's key is not diagnosed). Captures hold end-user
content: keep them out of the repository, share the --json output rather than the captures,
and delete them when the work is done. Requests that replay no thinking block are skipped by
default (they cannot fail the check); --include-no-thinking sends them too.

Capture format: one request body per line, in the order the harness sent them, for ONE
conversation (a directory holds one file per conversation). A line may also be a wrapper
{"conversation_id": "...", "headers": {"anthropic-beta": "..."}, "request": {...}} so several
conversations can share a file and the capture's own beta values travel with it (they are merged
into the anthropic-beta value the probe sends).
Assistant turns must carry the thinking blocks exactly as the API returned them (signature
included) -- that is what the API checks. Captures taken from another organization's traffic
cannot be replayed meaningfully: the API only diagnoses blocks your own organization created.

What the probe changes on every request: the anthropic-beta value thinking-binding-controls-2026-08-01
(plus --beta values and the capture's own), thinking.block_binding.prefix_mismatch_behavior = --mode,
max_tokens = --max-tokens (default 16: the verdict is decided before the first output token, so the
reply is not needed and the replay stays cheap), and stream off unless --stream. Any
other spelling of the mismatch-behavior field found under block_binding in a capture is removed so
that only the documented name is sent. A request with no thinking configuration is sent with {type: adaptive} (on models with preserved thinking
that is what the API runs anyway, and the thinking configuration is outside the compared prefix); a request
with {type: enabled} is rewritten to adaptive for the same reason; thinking disabled is SKIPPED. On every
request that declares tools the probe sets tool_choice to none (outside the compared prefix) so that no
tool -- server-side or the harness's own -- can run during a replay; it never removes tools from the
capture, because the tool set IS compared. temperature is set to 1 and top_p / top_k are removed (a
thinking request rejects them). Every such change is printed as a "shaped:" note. Nothing is sent without
--yes. --count-tokens replays against /v1/messages/count_tokens, which runs the same conversation check
for free (a 400 in --mode error is the break signal; no input_transformations on a 200).

Status words per turn: BREAK (a prefix-check drop or rejection), ok (replayed thinking, nothing dropped),
none (the request replayed no thinking block, so it could not fail), model (only model-check drops: a
model switch, not a prefix edit), WARN (a drop reason this probe does not classify), HTTP nnn / N/A
(not evaluated). Exit status: 0 no break, 1 inconclusive, 2 at least one break -- not severity-ordered.

What it records per request: HTTP status, every input_transformations entry, the
anthropic-thinking-prefix-mismatch response header if the API sent one, request id, usage, and a
client-side digest of the three compared parts (system, tools, and the messages before each
replayed thinking block) so the request where a digest changed can be found without the header.
A model_binding_mismatch entry (the current model cannot read a block another model produced -- a model
switch, not a prefix edit) is counted apart from prefix breaks: per turn as model_drops, per conversation
as model_drop_turns. It never makes a request fail, in either mode.

Per conversation: the first request (turn) with a prefix_binding_mismatch drop, the number of NEW
dropped blocks per request -- keyed by the dropped block's signature (or a redacted block's data),
resolved from the body that was sent, because paths shift when history is truncated; the path is
kept in the record -- the distinct dropped blocks in total (turns of reasoning lost), and the
diagnosis pattern(s) seen. A request whose status is not 200, and not a 400 that says "bound to a
different conversation", is NOT EVALUATED (a 401, a 429 that outlasted the retries, a network
error, ...): it is reported as such, and a conversation with any unevaluated request is marked
inconclusive and left out of the break share. A 200 whose body carries NO input_transformations
key at all is also NOT EVALUATED: the check never saw the request (a gateway stripping the beta
header, or a surface without the controls). So is a 200 carrying a thinking_mismatch_allowed
entry: the probe sets thinking.block_binding on every replay and a request that sets the field
never receives one, so the field was stripped on the way (a gateway or proxy rebuilding the
body) and the check ran record-only. Exit status: 0 clean, 1 inconclusive or errors,
2 breaks found. --json is validated before the first request and written after every request, so
a bad path costs nothing and a crash loses nothing.

Costs real money: every replayed request is billed (input tokens; the reply is capped). Use a
small slice; --max-requests caps it; --dry-run prints an input-token estimate for the approval.
Replaying does not run the application's own tools (the capture already holds their results), and
server-side tools -- web search, code execution, MCP connectors -- cannot run either, because the
probe sets tool_choice to none on every replayed request that declares tools; never remove tools
from a capture to the same end (the tool set IS compared).

# text can only mislabel that one conversation - the stored text is

# evaluated and its error is reduced, never shared. The block path's two
